# INF Starter Perks
Adds a bunch of mutations and perks with the goal of allowing more variety for the playstyles:

Negative encumbrance perks! 

A variety of trade off perks (Much faster healing at the cost of total health, faster but more fragile, stronger but slower, etc.) 

A selection of starting items (Multi-tool, katana, Zweih√§nder, atompot, medkit, etc) 

Genetic perfection mutation (it prevents getting most bad mutations in the game, may lock you out of some mutation paths.) 

One Challange perk (Deadblood - completely disabled natural healing, forcing you to rely on spells or regeneration items.)
