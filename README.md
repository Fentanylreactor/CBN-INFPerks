# INF Starter Perks
Adds a bunch of mutations and perks:
Trade off perks (Speed for strength/more damage, etc. Other way around. Less HP for faster healing.) 
A selection of starting items (Multi tool, katana, Zweih√§nder, atompot, medkit, etc) 
Genetic perfection mutation (it prevents getting most bad mutations in the game, may lock you out of some mutation paths.) 
One Challange perk (Deadblood - completely disabled natural healing)
